						<p>Born in Guadalajara, Simona spent much of her childhood painting with her mother who was a renowned Japanese painter. She began using skin as her canvas some years later. She has worked as a tattoo artist in Mexico City, Los Angeles, Paris, and London. She fell in love with our resident globe trotter Stevo in London a few years back. She loves a challenge clearly (!), so come in and chat with her if you have an idea that you’d like her to be bring to reality or you’re looking for inspiration or a simple exploration about what’s possible. She specialises in Japanese and New School.</p>

						<p>Rodolfo, originally from Venice Beach, California, came to visit Ireland after falling in love with the tv show Father Ted. Five years later, he now calls Dublin his home. You might not think it, but Rodolfo is the resident agony aunt and can be regularly seen comforting Stevo after another lost battle in love! He is a really talented artist and can make any idea come to life.  He has a huge variety of styles in his arsenal, specialising in Tribal and Chicano. Come in with your idea for a chat or just come for a hug! You won’t be disappointed!</p>
